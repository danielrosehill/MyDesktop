## Current desktop specifications

Build 1, V1.0

Component	|  Supplier	|  Model	|  Link	|  Notes
---- |---- |---- |---- |----

Motherboard	| Asus	| H110M-K	| Link |	1 PCIe16 only. So, if I want to run a dual GPU setup, this is a bottleneck.
CPU	| Intel| 	i3 7100 3.9Ghz 3MB Cache s11151	| Link	| This might seem like a basic CPU, but I don’t game and use the PC almost exclusively for office work. I edit images almost daily and video occasionally. My laptop has an i7 and, with my average workload, I can’t say that I notice any difference in performance.
RAM	| Kingston | 	ValueRAM 8GB 2400Mhz x 2 (16GB total)	|	My motherboard has two RAM slots so the only way to upgrade, at this point, is to swap out an 8GB stick with something of larger capacity. I actually hit the 16GB from time to time when I have a lot of Chrome tabs open and am running a VM. So 32GB would be better for my next build.
PSU	| Antec	| Antec 400W BP400PS	| Link	| This is obviously only a 400W PSU. My GPU actually only requires 300W according to its spec sheet. But a recent “frog croaking” sound coming from somewhere in the PC indicates that something is up. I presume this PSU has an international product name.
GPU	| Geforce	Nvidia Geforce GTX 1050 Ti Windforce OC, 4G |	Link |	I went for this particular GPU because it seemed like the best NVIDIA option that could work with my current PSU and would take me towards my eventual aim of running a six monitor display.
Case | 	Sharkoon |	VS4-S Black ATX Case |	Link |	
Storage |	Kingston	| SSDs x 4	| Link |	See: My Ubuntu backup strategy if you’re curious why I run 4 SSDs, which is the the maximum amount that my motherboard can support. 1 is my “production” Ubuntu OS, 1 is Windows, and 2 are used exclusively for storing backups (Clonezilla images and Timeshift restore points). Yes, the latter could be HDDs but ….. noises.
Cooler |	Noctau |	NH l9x65 |	Link
